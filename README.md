# AdvancedSockets
AdvancedSockets extends the current sockets, http and web functionality in .net with a websocket server, websocket client, api client and http server.

## Usage
I highly recommend looking at the example projects to see how everything works. As much as I love to write everything down, these examples are just better at explaining how everything works than a readme does.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Feel free to send in a pull request any time. But please do create an issue first explaining what you are about to change and why.
